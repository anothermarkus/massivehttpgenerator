# General Purpose Client Server App that distributes batches of calls

Rather than the company spending $5 on a ready built product, rather it makes sense to spend hundreds of hours building something custom and buggy!
This tool was supposed to make a huge batch of HTTP calls to fix problems with tarrifs. Only had one day to work on it and it was due yesterday.

Postman had a 25 query limit, this is a poor man's postman.
